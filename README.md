Wk6 Assignment
##Cookie Clicker Assignment Season 2##

###Reflections:###

**Requirements achieved:**
useState Hook
useEffect hook
separate files used for components
game state running smoothly and updating every second

-From the Stretch goals:
upgrades purchasable
save and retrieve from local data
nice styling including audio and glow buttons

**Requirements that I was unable to achieve**
The way I set the game up, I didn't see that I needed to use .map function as I had three upgrade options. I think it would be required if I had used the API.

**Other reflections:**
Starting the project without initially mapping it out. I went back to the start and mapped out my components.
I tried to shorten code in App.js but without success. Any guidance here would be great.

I googled and used ChatGpt when stuck on code that didn't work. used dev.to for help with my glow buttons and the breakout room to talk through what I was doing.
